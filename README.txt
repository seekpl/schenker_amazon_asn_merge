The program separates the DB Schenker waybill pages into .jpg format,
then extracts the ASN number and EAN barcode from the ASN number file generated by Amazon,
and combines it with the .jpg file of the DB Schenker waybill in the e-mail field.

For the program to work properly:
1) Open the PDF of the waybill and the PDF of the ASN number.
2) Click "Convert" - The PDF files will be saved as separate pages in .jpg format.
3) Click on "Cut ASN number" - cuts the ASN number and EAN code separately and saves them as .jpg files.
4) Click on "Merge" - the ASN files will be merged with the DB Schenker jpg files.
